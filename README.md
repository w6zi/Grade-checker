# Grade-checker
You can easily use this to manage school much better and in a fun way too! check README for more




# Grade Game is a Python desktop app that helps you manage schoolwork using a **real point-based priority system** instead of vague to-do lists.

Instead of using simple “importance levels,” you assign each assignment a numeric priority (5–100 points), and the app calculates what you should work on using factors like:

- Deadline urgency
- Your current performance (risk)
- Priority weighting

This makes your study decisions **data-driven instead of random**.

##  Features

###  Point-Based Assignment System
Each assignment gets a priority score from **5 to 100** which directly affects:
- Study recommendations
- Scheduling decisions
- Time suggestions

###  Smart “What to Study” Engine
The app calculates a priority score using:
Priority = Base Points × Urgency × Risk

yaml
Copy code
So a low-grade, high-importance, near-due assignment automatically becomes the top priority.

###  Study Streak Tracker
Click “I studied today” to:
- Track how many days in a row you’ve studied
- Save your **longest streak**
- Build consistency over time

###  GPA Simulation
Simulate grades before you actually get them:
- “What happens if I get a 62 on this?”
- “Is my A safe?”
- “How much does this test affect my grade?”

###  Performance Trends
View grade trends over time with simple built-in charting to visually track improvement.

###  Auto-Saving
All your data is stored locally in `grade_data.json` so nothing is lost when you close the app.
